Paladins Special Randomizer is an alternate version of my randomizer which allows users to select a defined pool of champions to randomly select, instead of choosing from the entire champion pool. Unlike the original Paladins Randomizer, this randomizer does not support random items, loadouts, or talents.

Goals:
 - Allow users to add champions to a pool
 - Allow users to remove champions from the pool
 - Prevent useres from adding non-champions or duplicate champions
 - Allow users to randomize champions in the pool
 - Create a clean and easy to use interface
